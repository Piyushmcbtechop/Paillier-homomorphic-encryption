STUDY OF IMAGE ENCRYPTION USING PAILLIER HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION

Cloud Storage and Privacy Concerns: Cloud storage enables image storage and editing but raises privacy risks from unauthorized access or accidental exposure. Traditional encryption secures data but limits editing without decryption.

Homomorphic Encryption Solution: Homomorphic encryption, like Paillier Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), allows secure computations on encrypted data without decryption, addressing privacy concerns in cloud-based image editing.

PHE for Image Security: Images are encrypted with Paillier's cryptosystem before cloud upload, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access to raw data.

Privacy-Preserving Image Editing: Demonstrates secure editing tasks, like brightness adjustments, on encrypted images to enable functionality without compromising privacy.

Technology Used: The implementation is carried out using Python, leveraging its extensive libraries for cryptography and image processing.

Real-World Applications: Explores PHE's potential for secure image transformations (e.g., contrast, rotation) and its integration into privacy-focused cloud services.
